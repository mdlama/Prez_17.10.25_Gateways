# Gateway challenges

### Core challenges
* **Audience (_faculty and students_)**:  Gateway must address two different audiences.
--

* **Context (_research and education_)**:  Faculty themselves have very different needs.
--

* **Content (_faculty training_)**:  Faculty need training not only in computational tools and quantitative/statistical concepts (which are underdeveloped in undergraduate curricula), but also in the pedagogical strategies in bringing these to the classroom.
--


### Cultural challenges
--

* **Isolation**:  Difficult for faculty to share teaching materials and strategies, due to fear of public scrutiny.
--

* **Recognition**:  Recognition of teaching scholarship in hiring, promotion and tenure is underdeveloped and widely variable.
--

* **Adoption**:  Adopting existing teaching materials from repositories is challenging as modifications are almost always necessary.

## .subheader[QUBES: Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis]

&lt;br \&gt;
![](www/img/qubes_logo_web_200x60.png)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
QUBES is a community of math and biology educators who share resources and methods for preparing students to use quantitative approaches to tackle real, complex, biological problems.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is QUBES?

---

# Data Science challenges (in Biology)

 * **Faculty training**: Biology faculty are not domain experts in statistics and data analysis
--

 * **Messy data**: Many opportunities in using real data, but *real data is messy*
--

 * **Complex software**: Many opportunities in using research tools, but *software is complex*
--

 * **Accessibility**:
   * Lack of user-friendly *open-source* software
--

   * Computers in labs might require substantial setup prior to use of software
--

   * Student laptops are highly variable in computational ability, setup and maintenance
--

 * **Cognitive overload**: Biology students need to learn biology, math, physics, chemistry, statistics, experimental design, data skills, etc.
--

   * **Scripting/Programming**: Reproducibility is becoming more important in science.

### Faculty Mentoring Networks are:
* Online groups, typically 10-15 faculty members
* Focused on a specific topic or material
* Typically meet every two weeks over a period of several months
* Led by teams of expert content and pedagogy mentors

# The Bridge

### How can we get studentâ€™s manipulating and analyzing data as fast as possible (i.e. *doing science*), while at the same time creating a scaffold to scripting skills?
